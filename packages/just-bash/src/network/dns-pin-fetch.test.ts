/**
 * End-to-end test that secureFetch pins DNS resolution at the actual
 * connection layer to the address validated at preflight.
 *
 * The CRITICAL DNS rebinding finding said the preflight DNS lookup
 * (in checkAllowed) and the connect-time DNS lookup (inside undici
 * under globalThis.fetch) were independent, so an attacker controlling
 * authoritative DNS could return a public IP at preflight and 127.0.0.1
 * at connect time. The fix wraps the actual fetch in `pinDns(...)`,
 * which intercepts `dns.lookup` for the validated hostname so that
 * undici receives the pre-validated IP.
 *
 * To prove the fix engages, we install a stub `globalThis.fetch` that —
 * inside its body — calls `dns.lookup` for the same hostname. If pinning
 * is active, the lookup must return the pinned IP, NOT what real DNS
 * (or the test default) would return.
